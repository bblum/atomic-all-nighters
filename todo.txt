milestones:
	get constraint solving working w/o flow control
		add constraints where TODO constraints are
		make current-context possibly symbolic
		make sure that splitting/merging for flow doesn't overwrite msgs/constraints/nextRV/EV
	figure out how to sanely report errors in flow control
		checkBackEdge
		mergeContexts/checkMerge
		etc?


features:
	when exiting ifs, effect1 == effect2
	with for loops:
		back-edge net effect has to be 0
		advanced: have a "warning level constraint" to check no-changes
	when dealing with Enable(+inf)/Disable(-inf), process the [E]s in-order


cleanup:
	fix unnamed argument bug (XXX in checkDerivedDeclrs)
	add a "tcwarn" for c typecheck errors, can be suppressed
	hmm, I don't like the way RuleConstraint's 'r1' is always RuleConst?
